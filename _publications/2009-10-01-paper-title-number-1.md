title: "A Kripkean Theory of Truth for Unrestricted Higher-Order Languages"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: 
excerpt: 'This paper develops a Kripkean truth theory for higher-order languages that is
compatible with absolute generality. Existing accounts either omit
truth-theoretical elements or focus only on first-order languages. To fill
this gap, I generalize existing literature to cover unrestricted higher-order languages
and develop an absolutist-friendly interpretation of higher-order expressions. The
theory models key features of natural language, including categorical reference to
mathematical structures, a type-free truth predicate, and generality absolutism.'
