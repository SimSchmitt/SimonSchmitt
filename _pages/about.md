I am a PhD candidate at the Center for Logic, Language, and Cognition (LLC) at the University of Turin. My primary research interests lie in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, with a particular focus on the philosophy of set theory, theories of truth, and proof theory.  I am also interested in the philosophy of language.

I am writing my PhD thesis under the supervision of Andrea Iacona and Lorenzo Rossi. In my thesis, I develop a novel and intermediate position between generality absolutism and generality relativism, and apply it to theories of truth and set theory.

Apart from my thesis, I work on several other topics, including a paper on Feferman's unfolding program (with Martin Fischer and David Hofmann), an application of contextualism to set theory (with Lorenzo Rossi and Chris Scrambler), and a paper on the Universe-Multiverse debate in set theory (with Matteo de Ceglie).
