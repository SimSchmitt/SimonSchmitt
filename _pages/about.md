Hi there! I'm Simon, a Logician and Philosopher. I hold a BA in Philosophy from the University of Heidelberg (2019) and an MA in Logic and Philosophy of Science from the MCMP in Munich (2021). Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the Center for Logic, Language, and Cognition (LLC) at the University of Turin and a Lecturer in Logic at the University of Salzburg.

My primary research interests are in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, with a particular focus on the philosophy of set theory, theories of truth, and proof theory. I also have a strong interest in the philosophy of language.

I am writing my PhD thesis under the supervision of Andrea Iacona and Lorenzo Rossi. In my thesis, I develop a novel, intermediate position between generality absolutism and generality relativism, and apply it to theories of truth and set theory.

Apart from my thesis,I work on several collaborative projects. These include a paper on Feferman's unfolding program (co-authored with Martin Fischer and David Hofmann), an application of contextualism to set theory (with Lorenzo Rossi and Chris Scrambler), and a paper on the Universe-Multiverse debate in set theory (with Matteo de Ceglie).
